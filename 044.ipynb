    "  * offset: the difference between sequence-terms' indexes, i.e., $n=\\left|j-k\\right|$ from the pentagonal pair $(P_{j},P_{k}),$ taken from the sequence of pentagonal numbers $P=p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots,$ where all the notations $p_{n} = P_{n} = P(n)$ mean the same thing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial thoughts\n",
    "Originally, I thought, \"Hey, let's just have a couple loops over values of $j$ and $k$ and keep track of the best difference we've encountered and do that for a long time.\" I felt like there'd be extra work in that case, either in the form of calculating unnecessary values for some $(j,k)$ pairs, or some logic that adjusted the $[j,k]$ window in such a way to avoid the previous (since I'm not convinced that \"window\" moves in a \"nice\" way; like HoP, it \"jumps around\" and I supposed the problem in this context is Kriss Kross).\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, I thought something about secants of the function $P_{n}=\\frac{n\\left(3n-1\\right)}{2}$ being somehow related to the difference and usable as an easy way to avoid the trickiness with the simple loops above. I no longer think that's the best way to go, but why not do something similar with the difference itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets change the question a bit; but first, let's set a few things up:\n",
    "  1. W.L.O.G., $k \\geq j.$ We strengthen this to strictly greater than by noting that 0 is not pentagonal (and the difference of the two pentagonal numbers $P_{j=k}$ and $P_{k}$ must be pentagonal).\n",
    "  2. I'm not sure if this is helpful or even useful (maybe it's the opposite), but \"in terms of\" the $[j,k]$ window, I currently prefer to think of it as a starting point $j$, and a \"window-width\" $n$. I think this may be useful when trying to express the difference and sum as a function of $j$ and $n=k-j$, instead of just $j$ and $k$. My feeling (based on very little, maybe no evidence) is that it will simplify the expresssions more.\n",
